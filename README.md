## What Is Wasteback Machine?

Wasteback Machine is a JavaScript library for measuring the size and composition of archived web pages (mementos) from the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org).

## Why Use Wasteback Machine?

Wasteback Machine retrieves mementos with high fidelity, removing archive linkage and replay-preserving modifications, and excluding replay-induced distortions, while preserving temporal coherence. The library extracts and classifies binary resources (URI-Ms) to accurately measure page size and composition.

The method overcomes the limitations of live-measurement approaches by recognising the unique nature of web archives as re-born digital objects and navigating their complexities to make them analytically tractable. This enables retrospective analysis of websites.

Its modular design supports integration into research workflows, analytics pipelines, and sustainability assessment tools, facilitating the study of web evolution and informing interventions to measure the internet’s environmental impact.

## Features

- **Retrieve mementos by date or timespan:** Selects the nearest memento if the exact timestamp is missing.
- **Analyse page composition:** Measure sizes of HTML, style sheets, scripts, images, videos, fonts, etc.
- **Generate detailed resource (URI-M) lists:** Includes URLs, types, and sizes of all URI-Ms.
- **Retrieval completeness score:** See what percentage of a memento was successfully retrieved.

## Installation

### Using NPM

To install Wasteback Machine as a dependency for your projects using NPM:

```sh
npm install @overbrowsing/wasteback-machine
```

### Using Yarn

To install Wasteback Machine as a dependency for your projects using Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @overbrowsing/wasteback-machine
```

## Usage

Wasteback Machine provides two primary functions:

1. Discover available mementos for a URL in a given time range.
2. Analyse a specific memento for page size and composition.

### 1. Fetch Available Mementos

```javascript
import { getMementos } from "@overbrowsing/wasteback-machine";

// Get all mementos for www.nytimes.com between 1996 and 2025
const mementos = await getMementos('https://nytimes.com', 1996, 2025);
console.log(mementos);
```

Example Output:

```javascript
[
  '19961112181513', '19961112181513', '19961112181513', '19961219002950', ...
]
```

### 2. Analyse a Specific Memento

```javascript
import { getMementoSizes } from "@overbrowsing/wasteback-machine";

// Analyse www.nytimes.com memento from November 12, 1996
const mementoData = await getMementoSizes(
  'https://nytimes.com',
  '19961112181513',
  { includeResources: true } // optional: include full resource list
);
console.log(mementoData);
```

Example Output:

```js
{
  url: 'https://nytimes.com',
  requestedMemento: '19961112181513',
  memento: '19961112181513',
  mementoURL: 'https://web.archive.org/web/19961112181513/https://nytimes.com',
  sizes: {
    html: { bytes: 1653, count: 1 },
    stylesheet: { bytes: 0, count: 0 },
    script: { bytes: 0, count: 0 },
    image: { bytes: 46226, count: 2 },
    video: { bytes: 0, count: 0 },
    audio: { bytes: 0, count: 0 },
    font: { bytes: 0, count: 0 },
    flash: { bytes: 0, count: 0 },
    plugin: { bytes: 0, count: 0 },
    data: { bytes: 0, count: 0 },
    other: { bytes: 0, count: 0 },
    total: { bytes: 47879, count: 3 }
  },
  completeness: '100%',
  resources: [
    {
      url: 'https://web.archive.org/web/19961112181513im_/http://www.nytimes.com/index.gif',
      type: 'image',
      size: 45259
    },
    {
      url: 'https://web.archive.org/web/19961112181513im_/http://www.nytimes.com/free-images/marker.gif',
      type: 'image',
      size: 967
    }
  ]
}
```

## Demo

A demo is available in [`examples/demo.js`](examples/demo.js). It integrates [CO2.js](https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/overview) with the 1Byte model to estimate the environmental impact of page data transfer.

The demo allows you to:
- Enter a URL and a target date (year, optional month and day).
- See page size results:
  - Total data transfer (KB)
  - Estimated emissions (grams CO₂e)
  - Completeness of retrieval
- View a breakdown of all assets including:
  - Number of files
  - Size (KB) and percentage of total page size
  - Estimated CO₂e per type

### Run the Demo

Run the demo with Node.js:

```bash
node examples/demo.js <URL> <Year YYYY> [Month MM] [Day DD]
```

Example:

```bash
# Analyse www.nytimes.com memento from November 12, 1996
node examples/demo.js www.nytimes.com 1996 11 12
```
